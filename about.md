# Hi I'm Kyle

Lighting has been my main passion as long as I can remember. My first experience with it was in grade school, and I've been trying to work it into my life ever since. 

I'm super into LEDs! 

I will try to fix anything that's broken!

I live in beautiful Santa Rosa, CA. I volunteer at 180 Studios Makerspace and do freelance lighting gigs.
